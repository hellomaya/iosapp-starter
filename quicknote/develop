DESIGN
=========

1. Dynamical layout parameters

To deal with different data type and requirement, we will have this feature
 that user can define the data what they need to save.
 
For instance, if it's to record daily living expense, you can have price, 
quanlity, image and so on for it. If you are going to record your daliy event, 
surly you will need another set of data type.

Layout is to define what field will be visible for current post, so it could be 

1.  image
2.  text
3.  note
4.  int
5.  decimal
6.  date
7.  date_range
8.  selection
9.  bit group => radio
10. bit => checkbox

user 1:n post 1:n type 1:1 layout
